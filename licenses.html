  <h2>AIUL License Tags</h2>
  
  <p>The AI Usage License (AIUL) framework includes six primary license tags, each representing a different level of permitted AI usage. These tags can be combined with optional media-specific suffixes to provide additional clarity for different types of assignments.</p>
  
  <h3>Primary License Tags</h3>

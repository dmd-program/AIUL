The AIUL-IU (Integrated Usage) license designates assignments where **AI usage is a required component**, with a focus on sophisticated AI integration and process documentation. This license is appropriate when working with AI tools is itself a core learning objective.

## Purpose

This license establishes a framework for assignments that explicitly engage with AI tools as a central component of the learning experience. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Teaching AI literacy and technical fluency
- Examining AI capabilities and limitations
- Developing prompt engineering skills
- Exploring ethical considerations in AI usage
- Understanding AI-integrated creative workflows

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Use AI tools extensively and intentionally as part of the assignment
- Demonstrate sophisticated prompt engineering and AI interaction techniques
- Document their process thoroughly, including prompts, iterations, and decision-making
- Reflect critically on the effectiveness and implications of their AI usage
- Be prepared to discuss both technical and ethical dimensions of their work with AI

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Provide clear guidance on expected AI tool usage
- Offer resources for developing prompt engineering skills
- Establish comprehensive documentation requirements
- Create opportunities for critical reflection on AI integration
- Design rubrics that evaluate both technical execution and conceptual understanding

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Detailed description of AI tools and techniques employed
2. Full prompt history showing iteration and refinement process
3. Analysis of AI outputs and their integration into the final work
4. Critical reflection on successes, limitations, and ethical considerations
5. Connections between AI usage and broader learning objectives

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this license only for technical courses?**  
A: No, this license is appropriate for any course where engaging with AI is a explicit learning goal, including humanities, arts, and social sciences.

**Q: How much AI usage is expected?**  
A: AI should be a central component of the assignment, not peripheral. The extent and sophistication of AI integration should reflect the learning objectives.

**Q: What if the AI doesn't produce what I expected?**  
A: Documenting challenges, limitations, and workarounds is a valuable part of the learning process under this license. Your reflections on these aspects are important.

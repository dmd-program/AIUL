title: AIUL-DP
full_name: "Directed Production"
order: 5
description: "AI-assisted creation is permitted with clear direction and modification from the student."
syllabus_text: "you may use AI-assisted creation with clear direction and modification from you. The concept, direction, and post-processing should demonstrate your creative input."
when_to_use:
  - The focus is on concept, direction, and post-processing rather than initial creation
  - You want to emphasize students' ability to guide and refine AI outputs
  - Technical execution is less important than creative direction
requirements:
  - Students may use AI tools to generate content under their direction
  - Students must provide clear creative direction to the AI tools
  - Students must apply post-processing and refinement to AI outputs
  - Students must document their prompts, direction process, and post-processing decisions
example: "Use this license for visual arts, creative writing, and design assignments where AI can be used as a production tool guided by the student's creative vision."

The AIUL-DP (Directed Production) license designates assignments where **AI-assisted creation is permitted with clear direction and modification from the student**. This license allows students to use AI as a production tool while maintaining creative control through direction and post-processing.

## Purpose

This license establishes a framework for AI-assisted production that emphasizes the student's role in directing and refining the creative process. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Developing skills in prompt engineering and AI direction
- Focusing on conceptual and editorial decision-making
- Learning to guide AI tools toward specific creative outcomes
- Understanding post-processing techniques for AI-generated content

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Provide clear, intentional direction to AI tools through careful prompt crafting
- Apply thoughtful post-processing and refinement to AI outputs
- Document the direction process, including prompt iterations and decisions
- Explain post-processing choices and their relationship to your creative vision
- Be prepared to discuss how your direction shaped the AI-generated elements

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Focus evaluation on the quality of direction and post-processing, not raw generation
- Provide guidance on effective prompt engineering techniques
- Establish clear documentation requirements for the direction process
- Consider how to evaluate creative decision-making throughout the process
- Design assignments that emphasize conceptual development and creative guidance

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Conceptual goals and creative vision for the project
2. Key prompts and direction provided to AI tools
3. Examples of iterations in the direction process
4. Detailed explanation of post-processing techniques applied
5. Reflection on how AI direction connects to broader creative decisions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to generate the majority of my content?**  
A: Yes, but the focus should be on your ability to direct the AI effectively and refine its outputs to match your creative vision.

**Q: What constitutes good "direction" of AI?**  
A: Effective direction typically involves clear prompt engineering, iterative refinement of prompts, and thoughtful selection/curation of outputs.

**Q: How much post-processing is expected?**  
A: Post-processing should be substantial enough to demonstrate your creative input and technical skills in refining AI outputs to match your vision.

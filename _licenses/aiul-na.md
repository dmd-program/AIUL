- Skill assessment
- Technical foundation building
- Learning processes that require manual practice
- Situations where work authentication is essential

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Complete all aspects of the assignment without using AI tools
- Document their process in the traditional manner required by the instructor
- Be prepared to explain their working process if asked
- Follow all other course guidelines for acceptable resources

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Clearly communicate expectations regarding acceptable resources
- Consider the purpose of the restrictions in relation to learning objectives
- Provide appropriate support resources that don't involve AI tools
- Design assessments that effectively measure the targeted skills

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are all digital tools prohibited under this license?**  
A: No, only AI-based tools are prohibited. Traditional digital tools like word processors, image editors, and calculators may still be permitted according to standard course policies.

**Q: How is compliance with this license verified?**  
A: Instructors may require process documentation, in-person demonstrations, or use AI detection tools where appropriate. The focus should be on learning outcomes rather than excessive verification.

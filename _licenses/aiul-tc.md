description: "AI may be used as a collaborative tool, but outputs must be significantly transformed."
syllabus_text: "you may use AI as a collaborative tool, but you must significantly transform and modify any AI outputs. Your work should demonstrate critical thinking and creative direction."
when_to_use:
  - The focus is on iterative development and refinement
  - Students should learn to direct and collaborate with AI tools
  - The process is as important as the final product
  - You want students to critically engage with AI outputs
requirements:
  - Students may use AI tools as collaborative partners in the creation process
  - All AI outputs must be significantly transformed and modified by the student
  - Students must document the AI tools used, prompts provided, and how outputs were transformed
  - The final work must demonstrate the student's critical thinking and creative direction
example: "Use this license for creative writing assignments, design drafts, prototyping, and assignments where AI can assist but significant human transformation is expected."

The AIUL-TC (Transformative Collaboration) license designates assignments where **AI may be used as a collaborative tool, but outputs must be significantly transformed**. This license encourages students to work with AI while ensuring substantial human input and creativity.

## Purpose

This license establishes a framework for human-AI collaboration that emphasizes critical engagement with AI outputs. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Developing skills in working with and directing AI tools
- Learning iterative refinement processes
- Understanding the strengths and limitations of AI generation
- Creating work that combines AI efficiency with human creativity

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Use AI tools as collaborative partners in the creation process
- Critically evaluate and significantly transform all AI-generated content
- Document the original AI outputs and your transformations
- Provide clear explanations of your creative decisions and modifications
- Be prepared to discuss your collaborative process and creative direction

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Define what constitutes "significant transformation" in the context of the assignment
- Provide examples of effective human-AI collaboration
- Establish clear documentation requirements for both AI outputs and student modifications
- Consider how to evaluate the quality and extent of student transformations
- Design assignments that require critical thinking beyond AI capabilities

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Which AI tools were used
2. Key prompts or queries provided to the AI
3. Examples of original AI outputs
4. Detailed explanation of transformations applied
5. Reflection on the collaborative process and decision-making

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What counts as "significant transformation"?**  
A: Transformation should demonstrate substantial creative input and critical thinking beyond simple editing. This might include structural reorganization, stylistic adaptation, conceptual reframing, or integration with original content.

**Q: Can I use multiple AI tools in collaboration?**  
A: Yes, using multiple tools and iterative processes is appropriate under this license.

**Q: How much of my final work can come from AI?**  
A: There's no specific percentage, but the final work should clearly demonstrate your creative direction and critical engagement. The AI should be a tool, not the primary creator.

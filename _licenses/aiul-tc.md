## AIUL-TC (Transformative Collaboration)

This license allows AI to be used as a collaborative tool, with the student significantly transforming, editing, and directing the AI output to create a final work that demonstrates student mastery.

### Requirements
- AI can be used as a collaborative assistant throughout the creative process
- Students must significantly transform any AI-generated content
- The final work must demonstrate the student's critical thinking and creative direction
- Students must document their AI collaboration process and how they transformed the output

### Appropriate Use Cases
- Creative writing with extensive editing and rewriting
- Iterative design projects with significant student modification
- Draft development with substantial student refinement
- Projects where AI serves as a creative partner rather than primary creator

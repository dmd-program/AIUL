description: "AI tools may be used for research and ideation, but the final work must be entirely student-generated."
syllabus_text: "you may use AI tools for research and idea generation, but the final work must be entirely your own. You must document any AI tools used in your process."
when_to_use:
  - Students can benefit from AI-assisted research or ideation
  - You want students to use AI for background knowledge or conceptual exploration
  - Final execution should demonstrate the student's own technical abilities
requirements:
  - Students may use AI tools only for research, ideation, and concept development
  - The final work must be entirely created by the student without AI generation
  - Students must document which AI tools were used and how they contributed to the ideation process
  - AI outputs may inform but not directly appear in the final work
example: "Use this license for research papers, creative briefs, project planning, and assignments where AI can help with background information but the execution should demonstrate student skills."

The AIUL-CD (Conceptual Development) license designates assignments where **AI tools may be used for research and ideation, but the final work must be entirely student-generated**. This license allows AI to support the planning phase while ensuring the execution remains the student's own work.

## Purpose

This license creates a balanced approach that harnesses AI for its strengths in information retrieval and idea generation while preserving the integrity of student-created work. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- Expanding research capabilities
- Supporting brainstorming and concept development
- Exploring multiple approaches before execution
- Learning to use AI as a research and ideation tool

## Guidelines for Students

Under this license, students should:

- Use AI tools to explore concepts, gather information, and develop ideas
- Document the AI tools used and how they contributed to the ideation process
- Create the final work entirely themselves, without AI-generated content
- Be prepared to discuss how AI-assisted research influenced their thinking
- Cite AI tools and prompts used in the research/ideation phase

## Guidelines for Instructors

When using this license, instructors should:

- Clarify the distinction between ideation and execution phases
- Provide examples of appropriate AI usage for conceptual development
- Establish clear documentation requirements for AI usage
- Consider how to evaluate the influence of AI on student thinking
- Design assignments that separate ideation from execution

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation should typically include:

1. Which AI tools were used
2. Key prompts or queries provided to the AI
3. How AI outputs informed the conceptual development
4. A reflection on how AI contributed to the ideation process
5. Clear delineation between AI-assisted ideation and student execution

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to outline a paper or project?**  
A: Yes, outlining and structural planning fall under conceptual development.

**Q: Can I use AI to rewrite or edit my final work?**  
A: No, the final execution must be entirely your own work.

**Q: How much detail should I include about AI-assisted research?**  
A: Documentation should be thorough enough to understand how AI influenced your thinking, including key prompts and how the information was incorporated into your conceptual development.

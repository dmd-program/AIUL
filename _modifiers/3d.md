## 3D (3D Design)

This modifier indicates that the assignment involves 3D modeling, animation, or virtual environments, where AI tools for 3D creation or manipulation might be applicable.

### Applicable Tools
- Text-to-3D model generators
- AI-assisted modeling tools
- Automated rigging systems
- Motion capture and animation assistance
- Texture and material generators
- Procedural environment creation tools

### Considerations
- 3D work often involves technical challenges where AI assistance might be valuable
- Consider whether understanding of 3D principles or final output quality is more important
- Some aspects (like UV mapping or rigging) might benefit from AI even when modeling is restricted
- Complex projects may require different levels of AI permission for different components

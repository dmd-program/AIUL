## MX (Mixed Media)

This modifier indicates that the assignment spans multiple media types, requiring consideration of different AI tools across various domains.

### Applicable Tools
- Any combination of tools from other categories
- Integrative platforms that combine multiple media types
- AI project management and coordination tools

### Considerations
- Mixed media projects may need different AI permissions for different components
- Consider whether to apply a single AIUL tag to the entire project or separate tags for each component
- Documentation becomes especially important to track AI usage across different media
- Integration and cohesion of elements may be more important than individual component creation

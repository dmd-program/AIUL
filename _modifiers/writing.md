## WR (Writing)

This modifier indicates that the assignment involves substantial written content, where AI text generation tools might be applicable.

### Applicable Tools
- Large language models (ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
- Text completion tools
- Grammar and style checkers
- AI writing assistants

### Considerations
- Text-based assignments often require clear attribution of AI assistance
- Consider requiring submission of early drafts to track development
- In collaborative writing with AI, emphasize student voice and critical thinking
- For longer written works, consider requiring annotations showing where and how AI was used

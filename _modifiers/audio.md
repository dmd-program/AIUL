## AU (Audio)

This modifier indicates that the assignment focuses on sound design or music creation, where AI audio generation or manipulation tools might be applicable.

### Applicable Tools
- AI music generators and composers
- Voice synthesis tools
- Audio enhancement and cleaning software
- AI-powered audio mixing and mastering tools
- Sound effect generators

### Considerations
- Consider whether theoretical knowledge of music/sound principles or technical execution is more important
- For performance-based courses, be clear about the role of AI in composition versus performance
- Audio assignments may require clear documentation of which sounds are AI-generated
- Hybrid approaches (AI-generated base with human performance overlaid) may need specific guidelines

## VD (Video)

This modifier indicates that the assignment involves moving images, where AI video generation or editing tools might be applicable.

### Applicable Tools
- Text-to-video generators
- AI video editing assistants
- Motion tracking and rotoscoping tools
- AI-assisted animation tools
- Deepfake and face-swapping technologies
- Video enhancement and upscaling tools

### Considerations
- Video projects often involve multiple stages where AI could be used differently
- Consider separate guidelines for pre-production, production, and post-production
- Time-intensive manual tasks might benefit from AI assistance even in otherwise restricted projects
- Be clear about expectations for original footage versus AI-generated content

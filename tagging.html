  <h2>AIUL Tagging Guide</h2>
  
  <p>Effective implementation of AIUL tags requires thoughtful consideration of learning objectives, assignment requirements, and student needs. This guide provides best practices for applying AIUL tags to your assignments.</p>
  
  <h3>When to Use Each Tag</h3>
  
  {% for license in site.licenses %}
  <h4>{{ license.title }}: {{ license.full_name }}</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    {% case license.title %}
      {% when 'AIUL-NA' %}
        <li>The learning objective specifically involves developing skills without computational assistance</li>
        <li>You need to assess a student's baseline abilities</li>
        <li>Technical proficiency with traditional methods is a core learning outcome</li>
        <li>Authentication of student work is especially important (such as exams)</li>
      {% when 'AIUL-WA' %}
        <li>Some students may benefit from AI assistance due to accessibility needs</li>
        <li>You want to maintain a primarily human-generated approach but remain flexible for specific cases</li>
        <li>You want to maintain some control over which AI tools are used and how</li>
      {% when 'AIUL-CD' %}
        <li>Students can benefit from AI-assisted research or ideation</li>
        <li>You want students to use AI for background knowledge or conceptual exploration</li>
        <li>Final execution should demonstrate the student's own technical abilities</li>
      {% when 'AIUL-TC' %}
        <li>The focus is on iterative development and refinement</li>
        <li>Students should learn to direct and collaborate with AI tools</li>
        <li>The process is as important as the final product</li>
        <li>You want students to critically engage with AI outputs</li>
      {% when 'AIUL-DP' %}
        <li>The focus is on concept, direction, and post-processing rather than initial creation</li>
        <li>You want to emphasize students' ability to guide and refine AI outputs</li>
        <li>Technical execution is less important than creative direction</li>
      {% when 'AIUL-IU' %}
        <li>Learning to work with AI tools is a core objective</li>
        <li>The assignment specifically focuses on AI ethics, capabilities, or limitations</li>
        <li>Students need to demonstrate prompt engineering skills</li>
        <li>The course is specifically about AI-integrated creative practice</li>
    {% endcase %}
  </ul>
  {% endfor %}
<!--   
  <h3>Choosing Media-Specific Suffixes</h3>
  
  <p>Media-specific suffixes help clarify which types of AI tools are relevant to the assignment:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Suffix</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example Use Cases</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for modifier in site.modifiers %}
      <tr>
        <td><strong>-{{ modifier.title }}</strong> ({{ modifier.full_name }})</td>
        <td>{{ modifier.description }}</td>
        <td>{{ modifier.example }}</td>
      </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>If an assignment involves multiple media types but focuses primarily on one, you can use the primary media suffix. For more complex assignments, the <strong>-MX</strong> suffix is appropriate.</p> -->

  <h3>Documentation and Transparency</h3>
  
  <p>For assignments with tags AIUL-CD through AIUL-IU, we recommend requiring students to document their AI usage. This documentation might include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Which AI tools were used</li>
    <li>How they were used in the process</li>
    <li>What prompts or inputs were provided</li>
    <li>How AI outputs were modified or integrated</li>
    <li>Reflections on the human-AI collaboration process</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This documentation promotes transparency, encourages reflective practice, and helps students develop metacognitive awareness of their creative process.</p>

  <h2>AIUL Tagging Guidelines</h2>
  
  <p>Effective implementation of AIUL tags requires thoughtful consideration of learning objectives, assignment requirements, and student needs. This guide provides best practices for applying AIUL tags to your assignments.</p>
  
  <h3>When to Use Each Tag</h3>
  
  <h4>AIUL-1: No AI Allowed</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The learning objective specifically involves developing skills without computational assistance</li>
    <li>You need to assess a student's baseline abilities</li>
    <li>Technical proficiency with traditional methods is a core learning outcome</li>
    <li>Authentication of student work is especially important (such as exams)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>AIUL-2: Limited AI with Permission</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some students may benefit from AI assistance due to accessibility needs</li>
    <li>You want to maintain a primarily human-generated approach but remain flexible for specific cases</li>
    <li>You want to maintain some control over which AI tools are used and how</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>AIUL-3: AI for Research/Inspiration Only</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students can benefit from AI-assisted research or ideation</li>
    <li>You want students to use AI for background knowledge or conceptual exploration</li>
    <li>Final execution should demonstrate the student's own technical abilities</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>AIUL-4: AI as Collaborative Tool</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The focus is on iterative development and refinement</li>
    <li>Students should learn to direct and collaborate with AI tools</li>
    <li>The process is as important as the final product</li>
    <li>You want students to critically engage with AI outputs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>AIUL-5: AI-Assisted Creation</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The focus is on concept, direction, and post-processing rather than initial creation</li>
    <li>You want to emphasize students' ability to guide and refine AI outputs</li>
    <li>Technical execution is less important than creative direction</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>AIUL-6: Required AI Integration</h4>
  <p>Use this tag when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning to work with AI tools is a core objective</li>
    <li>The assignment specifically focuses on AI ethics, capabilities, or limitations</li>
    <li>Students need to demonstrate prompt engineering skills</li>
    <li>The course is specifically about AI-integrated creative practice</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Choosing Media-Specific Suffixes</h3>
  
  <p>Media-specific suffixes help clarify which types of AI tools are relevant to the assignment. Some considerations:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>-WR</strong> suffix for any assignment involving substantial written content</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-IM</strong> suffix for assignments involving static visual content</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-VD</strong> suffix for assignments involving moving images</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-AU</strong> suffix for assignments focusing on sound design or music</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-3D</strong> suffix for assignments involving 3D modeling, animation, or virtual environments</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-TR</strong> suffix for assignments involving physical art media where AI might be used for planning or reference</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>-MX</strong> suffix for assignments that span multiple media types</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If an assignment involves multiple media types but focuses primarily on one, you can use the primary media suffix. For more complex assignments, the <strong>-MX</strong> suffix is appropriate.</p>
  
  <h3>Documentation and Transparency</h3>
  
  <p>For assignments with tags AIUL-3 through AIUL-6, we recommend requiring students to document their AI usage. This documentation might include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Which AI tools were used</li>
    <li>How they were used in the process</li>
    <li>What prompts or inputs were provided</li>
    <li>How AI outputs were modified or integrated</li>
    <li>Reflections on the human-AI collaboration process</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This documentation promotes transparency, encourages reflective practice, and helps students develop metacognitive awareness of their creative process.</p>

However, AI-generated content (text, images, audio, video, 3D models, etc.) MAY NOT be directly used in the final assignment. Students must cite AI sources when applicable.",
        "AIUL-3": "AI tools may be used as a supporting tool for refining work, generating ideas, and assisting with technical aspects (e.g., grammar correction, color palette suggestions, audio enhancement). However, students must significantly contribute to and refine the final work beyond AI outputs. Students must document and credit their AI usage.",

The student should act as the creative director, making key artistic choices. All AI contributions must be clearly cited.",
        "AIUL-5": "This course includes assignments that require the use of AI tools for creation, experimentation, or critique. Students will explore AI-generated content as part of their creative process and will be expected to document their methods and reflect on AI’s role in digital arts.",
